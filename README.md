# ⚠️ Educational Phishing Simulation – Italian Postal Service Login Page Clone

This project is a **didactic simulation** of a phishing website designed for **educational purposes only**.  
It mimics the login page of an online service (in this case, Poste Italiane – the Italian Postal Service) to demonstrate how phishing attacks are structured and how users can identify them.

---

## 🚨 WARNING – This is NOT a real login page!

When a user attempts to log in, the form does **not** send any data to a server.  
Instead, it simply triggers a popup message like:

> “Thank you for giving me your password! 😈 (Just kidding! This is only a simulation.)”

---

## 🧑‍🏫 Purpose

This page is used in cybersecurity training sessions to:

- Show what phishing websites can look like
- Help users learn how to inspect suspicious URLs
- Discuss common red flags in fraudulent emails and login forms
- Simulate receiving a phishing link by email and identifying the deception

---

## 🚧 Technologies

- **HTML & CSS only**
- No data is collected or sent
- No JavaScript libraries, only basic DOM and alert()
